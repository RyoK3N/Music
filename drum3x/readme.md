## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **C Compiler** (e.g., GCC)
- **Pip** (Python package manager)

### Python Packages

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install psutil pygame matplotlib
```

## Prepare Sound Files
__Create a beats Folder:__ Place it in the same directory as your scripts.

__Add Drum Sound Files:__ Ensure you have 9 WAV files in the beats folder with the following filenames:

    --beats\
    ----Bass_Drum_Comb.wav
    ----Bass_Drum_Driven12.wav
    ----OH_Open_Hat_04.wav
    ----Bass_Drum_Driven.wav

    ----Bass_Drum_Driven1.wav
    ----LT_Low_Tom_06.wav
    ----SD_Snare_Drum_092.wav
Note: The sound files should be in uncompressed 16-bit PCM WAV format. You can convert your audio files using ffmpeg:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.wav -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 output.wav
```
